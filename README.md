It is worth mentioning that a court case involving ProtonMail was found. It shows that there is precedence in obtaining the identity of harassers using the platform: https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/press-release/file/1416926/dl

The affidavit in the case of Thomas Patrick Connally, Jr. provides a detailed account of how ProtonMail collaborated with law enforcement to identify the sender of threatening emails. Key points from the affidavit include:

1. **Formal Request for Information**: Law enforcement submitted a formal request to ProtonMail, providing evidence of the criminal activity and the impact on the victims.
2. **ProtonMail's Cooperation**: ProtonMail provided registration details, IP addresses, and other relevant information linked to the email account used by Connally.
3. **Linking Accounts**: The information provided by ProtonMail helped law enforcement link the ProtonMail account to other online accounts and activities, establishing Connally's identity.
4. **Use of Multiple Accounts**: Connally used multiple email accounts, which were linked through common passwords and other identifiers, further establishing control over the accounts.
5. **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: The entire process was conducted in compliance with legal and ethical standards, ensuring the admissibility of the evidence in court.

#### Relevance to Our Investigation
